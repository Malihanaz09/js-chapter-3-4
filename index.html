<h1>Chapter # 3</h1>
<h2>Practice exercise 3.1</h2>
<p> 1. Create an array to use as your shopping list with 3 items: "Milk," "Bread," and
"Apples." <br>
2. Check your list length in the <br>
3. Update "Bread" to "Bananas." <br>
4. Output your entire list to the console.</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 3.2</h2>
<p>1. Create an empty array to use as a shopping list. <br>
2. Add Milk, Bread, and Apples to your list. <br>
3. Update "Bread" with Bananas and Eggs. <br>
4. Remove the last item from the array and output it into the console. <br>
5. Sort the list alphabetically. <br>
6. Find and output the index value of Milk. <br>
7. After Bananas, add Carrots and Lettuce. <br>
8. Create a new list containing Juice and Pop. <br>
9. Combine both lists, adding the new list twice to the end of the first list. <br>
10. Get the last index value of Pop and output it to the console. <br>
11. Your final list should look like this:</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 3.3</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an array containing three values: 1, 2, and 3.</li>
       <li> Nest the original array into a new array three times.</li>
      <li>Output the value 2 from one of the arrays into the console.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 3.4</h2>
<p>
    <ol><li>1. Create a new myCar object for a car. Add some properties, including, but not
limited to, make and model, and values for a typical car or your car. Feel free
to use booleans, strings, or numbers.</li>
<li> Create a variable that can hold the string value color. This variable
containing a string value color can now be used to reference the property
name within myCar. Then, use the variable within the square bracket notation
to assign a new value to the color property in myCar.</li>
<li> Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it, such as
forSale. Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new value to the
forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for purchase.</li>
<li> Output make and model into the console.</li>
<li> Output the value of forSale into the console.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 3.5</h2>
<p>1. Create an object named people that contains an empty array that is called
    friends. <br>
  2. Create three variables, each containing an object, that contain one of your
    friend's first names, last names, and an ID value. <br>
  3. Add the three friends to the friend array. <br>
  4. Output it to the console.</p>

<h1>Chapter # 4</h1>
<h2>Practice exercise 4.1</h2>
<p>1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
  <br>  2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
  <br>  3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console,
    using the following syntax:
    if(myVariable){
    //action
    }
    4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether
    the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the
    console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an
    ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement
    insteadâ€”experiment!
  <br>  5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 4.2</h2>
<p>1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age
  <br>  2. Convert the response from the prompt to a number
  <br>  3. Declare a message variable that you will use to hold the console message for
    the user
  <br>  4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to
    confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
   <br> 5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to
    confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol
  <br>  6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if
    none are true
  <br>  7. Output the response message variable to the console</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 4.3</h2>
<p>1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable
  <br>  2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether
    their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not
  <br>  3. Output the response to the console</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 4.4</h2>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with JavaScript, the JavaScript function Math.
    random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0
    but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and
    using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to
    generate a random number between 0 and 9
    In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
  <br>  1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value
    is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You
    can increase this number as you add more results.
  <br>  2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can
    repeat back in the final output.
  <br>  3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different
    value from the random number generator.
  <br>  4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence
    printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case,
    assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
  <br>  5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case
    response, to the console after the user enters their question.</p>
<h2>Practice exercise 4.5</h2>
<p>1. Create a variable called prize and use a prompt to ask the user to set the
    value by selecting a number between 0 and 10
   <br> 2. Convert the prompt response to a number data type
   <br> 3. Create a variable to use for the output message containing the value "My
    Selection: "
   <br> 4. Using the switch statement (and creativity), provide a response back
    regarding a prize that is awarded depending on what number is selected
   <br> 5. Use the switch break to add combined results for prizes
   <br> 6. Output the message back to the user by concatenating your prize variable
    strings and the output message string
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter projects</h2>
     <h3>Evaluating a number game</h3>
       <p> Ask the user to enter a number and check whether it's greater than, equal to, or less
        than a dynamic number value in your code. Output the result to the user. </p>
        <h3>Friend checker game</h3>
<p>Ask the user to enter a name, using the switch statement to return a confirmation
    that the user is a friend if the name selected is known in the case statements. You
    can add a default response that you don't know the person if it's an unknown name.
    Output the result into the console.</p>
<h3>Rock Paper Scissors game</h3>
<p>This is a game between a player and the computer, where both will make a random
    selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors (alternatively, you could create a version
    using real player input!). Rock will beat out Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and
    Scissors will beat out Paper. You can use JavaScript to create your own version of
    this game, applying the logic with an if statement. Since this project is a little more
    difficult, here are some suggested steps:
    <ol>
        <li> Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors. </li>
    <li> Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and then
    do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the index
    values in the array of the 3 items. </li>
    <li>Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the
    random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of the
    matching item from the array.</li>
    <li> Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are
    the same, this results in a tie.</li>
    <li>Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results. </li>
    There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you
    could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory
    accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors. </li>
    <li>Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the
    computer selection and the result of the game.</li></ol>
